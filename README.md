<h1>Project Title: WØRKS Studios</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
WØRKS is a creative studio dedicated to cultural advancement through strategy and design. This is the code for the WØRKS website, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is for educational purposes only.

<h2>Usage</h2>
To use this code, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The navigation bar at the top of the page allows users to navigate to different sections of the site. The hamburger menu on the right side of the navigation bar expands to reveal additional links when clicked.

The main content of the site is contained within three sections:
<ol>
<li>Page 1: This section features a header with text and a down arrow that triggers a scroll to the next section.</li>
<li>Page 2: This section displays a grid of images with hover effects that change the background image of the section.</li>
<li>Page 3: This section contains a series of image elements with captions.</li>
</ol>
The script.js file contains the following functionality:
<ul>
<li>Loader animation: The loader animation is controlled by the loader() function, which hides the loader bars and text after a delay.</li>
<li>Scrolling: The scrolling behavior is controlled by the Locomotive Scroll library, which allows for smooth scrolling and scroll-driven animations.</li>
<li>Navigation: The navigation bar includes a hamburger menu that expands to reveal additional links when clicked. This behavior is controlled by the plusButton function.</li>
<li>Page transitions: The scroll object is used to control the transition between pages, and the scrollTo() method is used to scroll to specific sections.</li>
</ul>
